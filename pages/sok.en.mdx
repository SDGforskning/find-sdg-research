# Search

Find publications from Norway related to the Sustainable Development Goals. We currently cover works published from 2015 to 2022, with partial coverage of 2023.

Search tips: 

* Search using English or Norwegian terms - but search terms are not translated, so search in both languages to get more results.
* Choose an SDG using the "SDG" filter to get results related to a specific SDG; if you need to narrow down your search further, consider using 
the "SDG targets" filter (to limit to a target area under the SDG), or use the filters under "More SDG filtering options" (to limit to works related to action).

If you need help, take a look at [Search tips](/hjelp/sokehjelp), [FAQ](/hjelp/ofte-stilte-sporsmal), or [About this service](/om/om-tjenesten).
